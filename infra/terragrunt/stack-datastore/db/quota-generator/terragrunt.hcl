# üåê Root Terragrunt Configuration Inclusion
# This block imports the common configuration from the parent directory's terragrunt.hcl file.

# This block imports standardized component configuration from the shared components directory.

# located at: `_shared/_components/quota-generator.hcl`. This ensures that changes are reflected
# across all modules that utilize this shared configuration.
